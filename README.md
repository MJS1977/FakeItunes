# FakeItunes

This program is a school exercise designed to test how to make a program, 
that combines Thymeleaf, SqlLite, and REST API.

The database used is Chinook-database

What the program does:

+ Recieve REST Requests from external program (in this case, Postman) and execute SQL-request accordingly.
+ Show a webpage using Thymeleaf that shows a list of five random songs, artists and genres.
+ Page should also contain a search field that can be used for looking songs but this feature is not functional yet...
  
***

Root-folder also contains a file that has a collection of REST REQUESTS for testing purposes:

**FakeItunes_RestRequests.postman_collection.json**
